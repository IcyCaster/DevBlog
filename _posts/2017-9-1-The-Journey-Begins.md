## Working for MYOB

I’ve been working for MYOB for a month now! Wow, time is flying by!  <br />
I’m very happy with my decision to join MYOB because the culture/environment rocks, improvement is encouraged/valued and the people here are great!

### MYOB Values

MYOB focuses on six core values: 
Clients, Collaborate, Innovate, Passion, Results and Simplify. 
I enjoy having a clear idea of what the company values as it helps to set goals, make decisions and align my personal values with my work.

### Celebrate Success

MYOB’s initiative “Celebrate Success” creates a positive working environment. This fortnightly event provides a platform for any team to share recent successes/failures/learnings they’ve experienced. I mainly use this event to gain an insight into what the other (80+) MYOB products do.

### Future Makers

MYOB’s initiative “Future Makers” focuses on investing time in employees now so that they can contribute to a brighter MYOB future. I feel valued because MYOB is willing to invest time into my development. It’s a win-win because we can mutually benefit from my learnings. “Learning Labs” (workshops run by specialists), mentors (dedicated members to assist with your growth) and improvement times (time allocated in the day to self-improve) are all ways which are currently impacting my career and hopefully my future.
