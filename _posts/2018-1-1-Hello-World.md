## Why make a blog?

Welcome to my Developer Blog! Congratulations on being the only other person to read my blog!

I'm making this blog because I firmly believe in self-improvement. I want this space to be a place where I record my learnings as I grow as a developer. It will be a neat way for me to recall past experiences and draw from them when passing on knowledge.
