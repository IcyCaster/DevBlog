## Why make a blog?

Welcome to my Developer Blog! <br />
Congratulations on being the only other person to read my blog!

### But why???

I'm making this blog because I firmly believe in self-improvement. I want this space to be a place where I record my learnings as I grow as a developer. Itâ€™s also going to be a neat way for me to recall past experiences and draw from them when I need to pass on knowledge.
